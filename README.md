# Projects
This repository showcases various projects I've worked on, private repositories I contributed to.

## Cheating Hangman Game
- **Course:** Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Contributions:** Designed and implemented a dynamic Hangman game using `unordered_map` and `vector` to manage word families. Developed algorithms to filter word families based on player guesses and dynamically select the largest family to increase difficulty.
- **Tech Stack:** C++, Data Structures, Algorithms
- **Description:** A variation of the classic Hangman game that dynamically adjusts the difficulty level by filtering words based on previous guesses. The program ensures a challenging and interactive game experience.

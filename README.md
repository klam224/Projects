# Projects
This repository showcases various projects I've worked on, private repositories I contributed to.

## Cheating Hangman Game
- **Course:** Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Contributions:** Designed and implemented a dynamic Hangman game using `unordered_map` and `vector` to manage word families. Developed algorithms to filter word families based on player guesses and dynamically select the largest family to increase difficulty.
- **Tech Stack:** C++, Data Structures, Algorithms
- **Description:** A variation of the classic Hangman game that dynamically adjusts the difficulty level by filtering words based on previous guesses. The program ensures a challenging and interactive game experience.
  
##  Tic Tac Toe Game
- **Course:** Computer Organization and Assembly
- **Contributions:** Created a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game in MIPS Assembly, managing user input, turn-switching, and game board updates using low-level system calls. Implemented memory management and I/O operations to optimize performance.
- **Tech Stack:** MIPS Assembly, Computer Organization
- **Description:** A text-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using MIPS Assembly that includes user input management and dynamic board updates. Focused on efficient memory management and system-level operations.
